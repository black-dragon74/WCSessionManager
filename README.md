# WCSessionManager
---
`WCSessionManager` is a helper class that is supposed to make communication between watchOS and iOS much easier and elegant. Write less code and do more.

The class exposes a shared `singleton` instance. One can use it to handle all the communications to and from.

# Usage
---
Download the `WCSessionManager.swift` file and put it in your app's directory. Make sure it is available to both your app's and watch app's traget.
